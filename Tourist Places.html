            <th colspan="2"><p>Raigad fort information: Raigad is a hill fort that is roughly 25 kilometers from Mahad. This fort was restored by Chhatrapati Shivaji, who established it as his capital in 1674 AD. At Raigad Fort, a ropeway allows one to quickly ascend to the fort from the ground. Additionally, the fort overlooks the man-made “Ganga Sagar Lake.”
                Huge Door, or “Maha Darwaja,” is the only main route leading to the fort. The Nagarkhana Darwaja, the main doorway, is faced by a reproduction of the original throne in the King’s durbar inside Raigad Fort. From the doorway to the throne, this enclosure had been acoustically built to improve hearing.
                Raigad fort information: History Of Raigad Fort Renowned feudal lord Chandraraoji More, who ruled Jawali in the Western Ghats, was the one who started building the fort. The hilltop bastion known as “Rairi” was taken by Shivaji when he beat Chandraraoji in combat in 1656 CE. Before dubbing the fort “Raigad” or the “royal fort,” Shivaji enlarged and refurbished it considerably.
                The front of the fort was a steep route that led to it; it was surrounded on three sides by deep valleys. Shivaji chose to establish Raigad as his capital due to the fort’s commanding position and massive construction. When Shivaji was crowned at this fort in 1674 CE, he took on the title “Chhatrapati” at this location. 
                Since the coronation violated the Mughal emperor’s orders and represented a strong protest against Mughal authority, it is regarded as an important event in Indian history.
                Raigad fort information Fifteen years later, Raigad saw another power shift when Rajaram Bhosale I, the third Chhatrapati of the Marathas, was defeated by Mughal general Zulfiqar Khan at the Battle of Raigad in 1689 CE.
                The fort was renamed “Islamgarh” by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. In 1707 CE, Fateh Khan, the Peshwa of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, took over the fort, ruling it for the next twenty years. The Marathas regained control until 1813 CE. Meanwhile, the British targeted Raigad from 1765 CE, finally capturing it in 1818 CE through cannon fire. 
                They looted and destroyed the fort, dubbing it “the Gibraltar of the East” due to its steep, unapproachable nature, akin to the monolithic rock near the Mediterranean Sea.</p></th>

            <th colspan="2"><p>The stunning citadel on the Arabian Sea, Sindhudurg Fort, is located off the coast of Maharashtra, India. This fort is situated on a rocky island known as Kurte. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Maratha emperor, oversaw the fort’s construction, which started in the latter part of the 17th century. Its goal was to thwart naval assaults on the Maratha Empire by the British, Dutch, and Portuguese. 
                   Its defenses consisted of strong bastions and enormous walls. The fort’s enormous defensive holes that surround it are evidence of the Maratha people’s extraordinary engineering prowess. There’s a meandering, zigzag path that leads to the secret main entrance. Shivaji’s hand and footprints are visible on one of the walls, and a nearby temple is dedicated to the Maratha deity Bhavani.
                   Sindhudurg Fort, constructed by none other than Chhatrapati Shivaji, makes use of the natural cover that the nearby rocks offer. This stronghold, with its magnificent gates and sturdy walls, is both a well-known tourist destination and an intriguing historical relic. The massive fort’s ability to withstand the ages may have something to do with its distinct and exacting construction method. 
                   The foundation of the gigantic fortress was erected first, and the surrounding rocks served as an impenetrable natural barrier to keep out any attackers who might attempt to damage it. The 42 bastions of Sindhudurg Fort, which is surrounded by smaller forts like Padmagad, Rajkot, and Sarjekot Forts, are still standing. A small temple honoring the Chhatrapati is located among the exterior walls of the fort.</p></th>

                Though windmill projects were closed for couple of years, thestate government has now floated tenders inviting fresh bids for the project.The cost of the project is Rs 60 crores and it will generate 10 megawatts ofenergy.
                The Devgad plateau is ideal for such project and therefore authoritieshave decided to come up with windmills at the same site
                Earlier similar project was undertaken at the same site but it suddenlycollapsed due to the negligence of the state authorities.
                The company which was awarded for maintenance of the project wasgiven a contract for five years for a sum of Rs 5 crore. The company managed tocarry out maintenance work for only two years.
                State authorities also neglected the project and it turned outto be a dead investment. The energy generated by the project was bought by MaharashtraEnergy Distribution company.
                According to advocate Ajit Gogte former MLA of Devgad the energygenerated from windmills is cheap and therefore government should focus ontapping cheap energy sources.
                B S Bandgar chief engineer of the Energy Distribution Companyhas said that the new project of Rs 60 crore after completion will be handed to theMaharashtra State Electricity authority for maintenance.

                It was occupied by the Siddis and is famous for being the only fort along India’s Western coast that remained undefeated despite Dutch, Maratha and English East India Company attacks.
                The word Janjira is not native to India, and may have originated after the Arabic word Jazeera, which means an island. Murud was once known in Marathi as Habsan (“of Habshi” or Abyssinian). 
                The name of the fort is a concatenation of the Konkani and Arabic words for Island, “morod” and “jazeera”. The word “morod” is peculiar to Konkani and is absent in Marathi.
                Major features:
                Murud-Janjira Fort is situated on an oval-shaped rock off the Arabian Sea coast near the port town of Murud, 165 km (103 mi) south of Mumbai. Janjira is considered one of the strongest marine forts in India. 
                The fort is approached by sailboats from Rajapuri jetty. The main gate of the fort faces Rajapuri on the shore and can be seen only when one is quite close to it. It has a small postern gate towards the open sea for escape.
                The fort has 19 rounded bastions, still intact. There are many cannons of native and European make rusting on the bastions. Now in ruins, the fort in its heyday was a full-fledged living fort with all the necessary facilities, 
                e.g., palaces, quarters for officers, mosque, two big fresh water tank, etc. On the outer wall flanking the main gate, there is a sculpture depicting a tiger-like beast clasping elephants in its claws. 
                There are prominent “ASHOK-CHAKRAS” on all major gates of the fort Janjira. There are images of playing elephants, lions etc.</p>

Pawas is an important pilgrim center owing to Sri Swami Swarupanand Samadhi Mandir which is visited by thousands of devotees every year.
                Pawas is a serene place known for its natural beauty. Pawas came into the limelight after it was chosen by Swami Swaroopanad for his ashram. The Samadhi Mandir was constructed in the memory of Sri Swami Swarupanand who took Samadhi here on 15th August 1974. 
                Swami was born on December 15, 1903 at Pawas to the couple Vishnupant and Rakhmabai Godbole. His original name was Ramchandra, but he came to be affectionately addressed as Bhau or Appa. At the age of 20, Swami took initiation from Sadguru Babamaharaj Vaidya of Pune and from that onwards he had begun his spiritual journey. 
                Returning to Pawas, he undertook religious austerity and focused his mind on a deep study of Dnyaneshwari, Bhagvad Geeta and Dasbodh. Swami delivered the guru mantra of 'Ram Krishna Hari' to his followers, which is chanted till today.
                The Temple is very beautiful and one can get a feeling of intense satisfaction and peace in the temple premises. The Swami memorial and Swami's original residence, Anant Niwas, are very neatly maintained. In the premises of Swami's temple, there is a meditation room and a Lord Ganesh's idol carved onto an Emlica tree. The place is famous for its natural beauty and tranquility. 
                There are temples dedicated to Ganesha, Vishveshwar and Someshwar Shiv on either side of the river in this village. Guru Purnima and Swami's Samadhi are the two important festival days that are observed on a large scale at Pawas</p>
